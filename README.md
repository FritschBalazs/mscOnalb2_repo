# CMSIS-DAP compatible HighSpeed USB debugger

This repo contains all the softwares related to my MsC "Ã–nlab 2" course, and some experiments for the countinuation "Diplomaterv 1"

main branch: currently contains a working demo with CMSIS-DAP v1 runing in HID mode.
st_composite branch: is currently the same, just as a composite device with added CDC class for a serial port.
st_custom_class: development branch for creating a custom class to implement CMSIS-DAP v2, with custom bulk endpoints.

This is just proof of concept repo, so it's a bit messy.
